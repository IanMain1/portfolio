    <div class="four"><p>The poblano chili is used to make chili relleno. The poblano is thought to have originated in Puebla. Puebla is a State in Mexico located southeast of Mexico City. One story suggests it was the nuns in Puebla first <br>produced the dish we now call chili relleno. They called it 'Chile en Nogada' and possibly served it to interesting General in Mexican history after he was involved in a Mexican military victory in Puebla on the 5th of May. The Puebla nuns made their chili relleno in a walnut sauce and then sprinkled it with parsley and pomegranate seeds.</p>
